## Features

Musicritic has still got a long way to go, but here are some things you can already do!

-   Connect yourself to Spotify (required to make use of the rest of the features!);
-   Check your recently listened to tracks and recent top tracks;
-   Look up albums, tracks, artists, and playlists;
-   See more information on tracks and albums in specific pages.

### Installation and Usage

After cloning this repository, you'll need to install the dependencies. We suggest using yarn, so you should run `yarn install`.

Before getting to run Musicritic itself, you'll need to set up some environment variables. For this purpose, you'll need to create two integrations: one with [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and the other one with [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Both are very simple to configure, so don't let these additional steps scare you out!

With both configured, you'll just have to create a .env file in the root folder of Musicritic and fill it with information to link your applications with Musicritic. Check .env.example and simply fill in the required fields. Now, you should be ready to go... If you got stuck in the middle of the process, make sure to contact us at calluswhatuwant@gmail.com so that we can help you out!

With everything set, all that is left to do is run Musicritic. We suggest running `yarn dev`, which runs both client and server concurrently. If you'd rather run each one separately, `yarn client` and `yarn server`, respectively, are your go-to commands.

This is it! Now, if you make any modifications, the application should update itself automatically.
