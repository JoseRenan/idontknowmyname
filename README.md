### Installation and Usage

Before getting to run **Musicritic** itself, you'll need to set up some environment variables. For this purpose, you'll need to create two integrations: one with [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and the other one with [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Both are very simple to configure, so don't let these additional steps scare you out!

#### Configure Spotify and Firebase

Create a new file named `.env` with the same fields as the `.env.example` file. You're going to fill this file with information to link Spotify and Firebase with **Musicritic**.

##### Spotify

Access [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) with your *Spotify Account* and follow these steps:

1. Create a new `Client ID` in *DashBoard*
2. Fill the information that Spotify asks
3. After created, put the `Client ID` and `Client Secret ID` in the `.env`
4. Go to **Edit Settings** at your Spotify Client ID
5. Set the **Redirect URLs** to `http://localhost:5000/auth/callback`

##### Firebase

Access [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) with your Google Account and follow these steps:

1. Add a new project
1. Go to *Project Overview*
1. Click in the symbol `</>`
1. Copy your `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `databaseURL` and put it in the the `.env`
1. Click at Cloud Firestore, and at "Create Database".
1. Choose the test option and activate
1. Go to *Project Configuration > Service Accounts*
1. Click in *Create a new Private Key* and save the file in a safe place, please don't commit this file
1. Place the *full path* to your file at the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` fild in `.env`
1. On the sidebar menu, click on "Authentication", "Sign-in Method" tab and enable "Email/password" (same could be done with Google, Facebook and Twitter).
1. Let's create our user! Select "Users" tab, click on "Add User". Set "Email" and "Password". Use this credentials to log in on the application.


With both configured, you're ready to run **Musicritic**!

#### Staring Musicritic

With *Firebase* and *Spotify* configured, now you'll need to install the dependencies. We suggest using [*yarn*](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Access your [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), use the credentials you've configured on below steps and Voila! If you got stuck in the middle of the process, make sure to contact us at calluswhatuwant@gmail.com so that we can help you out!

> The API routes will be running on `/api/*`.

This is it! Now, if you make any modifications, the application should update itself automatically.
